### Guidelines for submitting issues

If you think you've found a bug, or have a feature request, then create an issue here on Github. You'll make my job easier if you follow these guidelines:

* If you're stuck, give me sufficient context so that I have a chance to identify the issue:
    * what version of terriffilter are you using? (look in your `Gemfile.lock`)
    * what version of Rails are you using? (look in your `Gemfile.lock`)
    * what version of Ruby are you using? (run `ruby -v` in your app root)
* If you get an exception, include the entire stack trace, including the error message.
* Include any relevant code snippets (your model, controller, and view code).
* When pasting code, please use [markdown code formatting](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks). It will be much easier to read.
