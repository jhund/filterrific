# Filterrific

Filterrific is a Rails Engine plugin that makes it easy to filter,
search, and sort your ActiveRecord lists:


### Features

* Makes heavy use of ActiveRecord Scopes
* ActionController helpers to shuttle filter params from ActionView forms to ActiveRecord based models, and to return matching records back from ActiveRecord to ActionView.
* Form helpers to build powerful search and filter forms with ease.
* Javascript assets to auto-submit filter form on change via AJAX.
* Image asset to show a spinner in the Filterrific form when new records are being loaded via AJAX.
* API option to use Filterrific with Rails API mode. Just use `gem 'filterrific', branch: 'api'` in your Gemfile.

### Guidelines for submitting issues

Please post questions related to usage at [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/filterrific) under the `filterrific` tag.

If you think you've found a bug, or have a feature request, then create an issue here on Github. You'll make my job easier if you follow these guidelines:

* Please keep in mind that I do this in my spare time. To you this software is free as in `beer`, to me it's free as in `baby`. I appreciate it if you first do everything you can on your own: read the detailed [Filterrific documentation](http://filterrific.clearcove.ca), look for similar issues on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/filterrific), search the internets, etc.
* If you're stuck, give me sufficient context so that I have a chance to identify the issue:
    * what version of filterrific are you using? (look in your `Gemfile.lock`)
    * what version of Rails are you using? (look in your `Gemfile.lock`)
    * what version of Ruby are you using? (run `ruby -v` in your app root)
* If you get an exception, include the entire stack trace, including the error message.
* Include any relevant code snippets (your model, controller, and view code).
* When pasting code, please use [markdown code  formatting](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks). It will be much easier to read.
